### PhD tasks 

#### 1. PM algorithm 
 	
1. Writing [extended version of paper for JCOMS journal selected by SoftComm conference](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HA4a3fPrKlDrNnGh0WUe-XxBZP37TuK_CfAJ71IgB-s/edit?pli=1#) **(CLOSED, PAPER SUBMITED)** 
3. [learn MCDM-AHP](https://github.com/vandit86/aesi-phd/issues/34) : Define FAHP logic, network selection algorithms, papers reading, solution comparation
4. Writing **[paper 4: MCDM algorithm based](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mFZpZ3p3tSh_LPt7hqiq2izenE61Lz8Hmpi8ZL4zCyI/edit#heading=h.k2pg3nxayr3t)**  

#### 2. Development

**mptcpd**

 1. Search for Traffic generation tools, with different traffic patterns (voice, video, web) to test MADM algorithm
 2. Configure .py script to define consistent pairwaise comparation matrix, and calculate weights vector, using dedicated pyhton lybrary new services should be integrated (voice and video?) 
 5. Implement fuzzy ahp solution plugin for mptcpd    
    - calculate score for each network/service and create logic to react accordingly.. 
    - solution can create or change subflow priority (background).. 
    - (**remove_sf**) does not provide any change ?? [see github issue](https://github.com/intel/mptcpd/issues/267)
     
**ns-3**
  1. Nothing to change 

#### 3. Other tasks

  1. Classes CC (2 turnos)

### Sprints

1. Task 1 (++++++++++++++%)  
2. Task 2 ()
3. Task 3 (++++++%) 


### Obs
Focus on FAHP and how to include vehicle mobility into decision process -> solution based on time vehicle pass in coverage area of RSU
