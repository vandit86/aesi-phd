2. Writing paper 4 : _An efficient radio access selection mechanism for hybrid vehicular networks_  

#### Development

1. try to increase thput on LTE channel .. (the maximum upload/download = 1.5 Mb/s )
	* veh speed not influence , useCa not influence , 
	* **remove delays** induced by tc :  LTE inetrface increase thput up to 4-5 Mb/s, on WLAN up to 5 Mb/s 	


#### Other tasks 
1. review on google Blogs and google site : idea to create own blog (or site) for PhD tasks descriptions ?
