	* Mobility-Aware Seamless Handover with MPTCP in Software-Defined HetNets (2021) (handover, fuzzy analytic hierarchy process sdn, mptcp, )

2. Writing paper 4 : _An efficient radio access selection mechanism for hybrid vehicular networks_  

#### Development

1. enable **CA service** on RSU and vehicles 
	* new branch -> modified SimpleCamSender-gps-tc.cc 
	* CAM is not sended  ?? maybe ipv6 problem since I set ipv4 addresess on interfaces.. but we can have 2 adrecess on iface..
