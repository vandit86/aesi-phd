### Sprints

1. Task 1 ()  
2. Task 2 ()
3. Task 3 () 


### Obs

Focus on FAHP and how to include vehicle mobility into decision process -> solution based on time vehicle pass in coverage area of RSU 
Pyhton lybrary was found with multiple **MCDM** algorithms to calculate weights vector:  _from pyDecision.algorithm import ahp_method_
